# io.github.patlego.examples.typescript

A simple repository to showcase how to use typescript

## Use Case

I enjoy seeing how clean TypeScript looks and all of the benefits that it offers compared to plain Javascript, but I never knew how to set one up. This project aims to set a simple `Hello World` TypeScript project.

I leveraged the following knowledge base articles in order to make this repository:
- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project
- https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/eslint-for-typescript/ 

## tsconfig.json

The TSCconfig file is a JSON file that describes how tsc compiler will convert the TypeScript code into Javascript

## eslintrc

The eslint file is a JSON file that allows users to run a linter on there code and make sure that the code that they are producing is of good quality. The ESLint will validate that the build is using the correct variable declaration types, double quote vs single quote and so on.

## package.json

The package.json defines the dependencies and the build commands used to build this project
